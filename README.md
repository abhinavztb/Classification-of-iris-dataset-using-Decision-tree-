# Classification-of-iris-dataset-using-Decision-tree

1)We loaded the iris dataset from sklearn data

2)Divide it into train and test data set

3)Then we have used a classifier : Decision tree

4)Decision Tree is a Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm

5)We use fit to train the model

6)Then we predict the data and test the accuracy of the model
