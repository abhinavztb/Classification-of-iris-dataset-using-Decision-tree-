# Classification-of-iris-dataset-using-Decision-tree
We loaded the iris dataset from sklearn data
Divide it into train and test data set
Then we have used a classifier : Decision tree
Decision Tree is a Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm
We use fit to train the model
Then we predict the data and test the accuracy of the model
